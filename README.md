# PDF Annotation Tool

A lightweight web application for annotating PDFs with highlights and comments.

## Features

- **Highlight Text**: Mark important text directly on the PDF.
- **Add Comments**: Attach comments to specific areas on the PDF.
- **Save Annotations**: Save all annotations for future reference (server-side saving functionality is pending implementation).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML5**: For structuring the web application.
  - **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
  - **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and core functionality.

- **Libraries:**
  - **PDF.js**: For rendering and interacting with PDF files. You'll need the latest version from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js).

- **Development Tools:**
  - **npm**: For package management, though not strictly needed for this project, it's good practice for managing dependencies.
